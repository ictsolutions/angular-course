# Tables

- The `<table>` element is used to add a table.  
- A table is drawn row by row. Each row is created with the `<tr>` element.  
- Inside each row, the cells are defined by the `<td>` element (or `<th>` if it is a header)
- A cell can span more than one row or column using the `rowspan` and `colspan` attributes.
- For long tables, the elements `<thead>`, `<tbody>` and `<tfoot>` can be used to split it in sections.
